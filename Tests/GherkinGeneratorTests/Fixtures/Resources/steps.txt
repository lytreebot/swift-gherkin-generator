Inventory Management

Check product availability
Given a product "Wireless Mouse" in the warehouse
And the current stock is 50 units
When a customer orders 3 units
Then the stock is reduced to 47 units
And the order is confirmed

---

Restock notification
Given a product "Keyboard" with stock below threshold
And the threshold is 10 units
When the stock reaches 8 units
Then a restock notification is sent to the supplier
But the product remains available for purchase

---

Bulk inventory update
Given a CSV file with updated stock levels
When I import the inventory file
Then all product quantities are updated
And a summary report is generated
